No more indecision, let the system take over

Usage:
---
Launch program with number of iterations and the semi-colon separated options. Like so:

    $ python main.py 100000 "pizza;deep dish;calzone"

    BEST CHOICE:    pizza
    TOTAL SCORE:    33449/100000
    DISTRIBUTED:    {'calzone': 33320, 'deep dish': 33231, 'pizza': 33449}

This bias yet accurate result is not guaranteed.
